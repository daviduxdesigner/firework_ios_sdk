# FireworkVideo Sample Code

## Overview

The sample code is provided to demonstrate the usage of FireworkVideo SDK in your app. When running the sample app, see "Code Examples" for how to programmatically show the FireworkVideo feed and "Storyboard" examples for use on Storyboard. Additional Storyboard examples as well as an example using SwiftUI are coming soon.

## Setup

The sample project is configured to use SPM to import FireworkVideo as a dependency. 

After first cloning the project in Xcode select File > Swift Packages > Resolve Package Versions. Then wait for the resolution to complete.

See [Setup Prequisites](https://github.com/loopsocial/firework_ios_sdk/blob/main/README.md#setup-prerequisites) for the remaining steps to complete FireworkVideo setup.

## Alternative Manual Setup

To integrate FireworkVideo SDK manually, remove the FireworkVideo SPM dependency first by going to FireworkVideoSample project in Xcode's Project Navigator > Swift Packages > Select firework_ios_sdk and click on the "-" button below the dependency list.

After removing the SPM dependency on FireworkVideo, follow the steps for [Importing FireworkVideo Framework Manually](https://github.com/loopsocial/firework_ios_sdk#importing-fireworkvideo-framework-manually) to complete the setup process.
